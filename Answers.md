Q.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
A: On a server side routed website when a user changes their url by clicking on a link, filling out a form or by entering it into the address bar their browser will request a whole new document from the server.

When a user changes their urls on a client side routed website the entire webpage will NOT refresh like a server side routed website. The state of the application will change resulting in a different view of the website.
